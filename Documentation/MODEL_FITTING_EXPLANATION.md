## BUSINESS IMPACT

**Primary Objectives Achieved:**
1. **Accurate Visitor Forecasting:** Predict daily visitor numbers across 7 distinct segments.
2. **Optimal Staff Allocation:** Determine appropriate crew sizes based on expected demand.
3. **Operational Efficiency:** Reduce under/over-staffing while maintaining service quality.
4. **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Replace intuition-based scheduling with statistical models.

---

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

**1. Data Processing & Feature Engineering**
- **Location:** `Data_Sources/Data_Processing/Imputer_Final_df.py`
- **Purpose:** Cleans, merges, and imputes raw data from multiple sources, producing a unified modeling table (`Table_for_modelling.csv`).

**2. Segmented Visitor Demand Prediction**
- **Location:** `Models/Segmented_Demand.py`
- **Algorithm:** XGBoost Regression (Gradient Boosting)
- **Approach:** Separate, specialized models for each visitor segment.
- **Features:** Temporal, weather, holiday, lagged/rolling, and external context variables.

**3. Crew Size Optimization**
- **Location:** `Models/Crew_Size_Prediction.py`
- **Algorithm:** XGBoost Classification
- **Integration:** Uses visitor predictions as primary input, plus historical crew patterns and operational constraints.

**4. Output & Reporting**
- **Location:** `Data_Sources/Data_Modelling/Predictions/`
- **Files:** Visitor and crew size predictions for operational use.

## DATA FOUNDATION

- **Volume:** 1,175 historical records
- **Features:** 61+ variables (raw and engineered)
- **Quality:** Comprehensive cleaning and validation in `Imputer_Final_df.py`
- **Coverage:** Multi-year, multi-source, multi-segment

**Data Sources:**
- Internal operations (visitor counts, crew schedules)
- Weather services (temperature, precipitation)
- Calendar systems (holidays, school breaks)
- Amsterdam events, hotel occupancy, tourism metrics

## FEATURE ENGINEERING HIGHLIGHTS

**Visitor Demand Model (`Segmented_Demand.py`):**
- **Temporal:** Season, day-of-week, month, holiday effects
- **Weather:** Temperature/precipitation bins, good/bad weather flags
- **Historical:** Lagged (1, 7, 14, 28 days), rolling means/stds (7, 14, 30 days)
- **External:** Events, hotel occupancy, tourism pressure

**Crew Size Model (`Crew_Size_Prediction.py`):**
- **Visitor Intelligence:** Segment ratios, capacity flags
- **Operational Memory:** Historical crew size lags, stability, weekday averages
- **Real-time Adaptation:** Weather/event-driven adjustments

## MODEL PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

- **Segmented Demand:** Segment-specific hyperparameters, regularization, feature selection, 80/20 temporal split
- **Crew Size:** Multiclass classification, top-20 feature selection, confusion matrix optimization

---

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION FLOW

1. **Data Ingestion:** Automated loading from all sources (`Imputer_Final_df.py`)
2. **Cleaning & Imputation:** NaN handling, merging, and validation
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creation of all features for both models
4. **Model Training:**  
   - Visitor demand: `Models/Segmented_Demand.py`
   - Crew size: `Models/Crew_Size_Prediction.py`
5. **Prediction & Output:** Results saved to `Data_Sources/Data_Modelling/Predictions/`
6. **Documentation:** All steps and features documented in `Documentation/`
